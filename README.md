shuttle
=======

A little mobile web app to help me not miss the parking shuttle at work. Also an excuse to get better at testing with Mocha &amp; Chai and CasperJS.

##Live Demo

[shuttle.kencox.net](http://shuttle.kencox.net)

##Building

    npm install && bower install

##TODO:
* Design something to alert me 5 minutes *before* the shuttle departs that it's time to pack up and go so I don't miss it... again.
* Make next shuttle time bold in the departure times, and increase the font size a little so I can read the times better
* Fully test the UI using CasperJS and make those tests run with grunt test
* Automate deployment with Grunt
